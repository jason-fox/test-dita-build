              <strong class="ph b">Dead simple</strong> - Include prism.css and prism.js, use proper HTML5 code tags
              (code.language-xxxx), done!
            </li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Intuitive</strong> - Language classes are inherited so you can only define the
              language once for multiple code snippets.

            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Light as a feather</strong> - The core is 2KB minified &amp; gzipped. Languages
              add 0.3-0.5KB each, themes are around 1KB.

            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Easy styling</strong> - All styling is done through CSS, with sensible class names
